# Which crates a release has to bump, and which it has to publish.
#
# A copy of cctop's tools/release-plan.sh (flolep2607/cctop), adapted to this
# fork. The fork publishes the crates cctop builds on as `cctop-rmux-*`; the
# rest of the workspace (`publish = false`) is never published and not
# checked. Each published crate has its own version. What the fork has instead
# of cctop's root crate is the release version,
# `[workspace.metadata.cctop-release] version` in the root Cargo.toml: every
# release bumps it, and its tag is `cctop-v<version>` (upstream's own `v*`
# tags live in this history too, so the prefix keeps the two apart). A crate is
# bumped only when it changed since the last release tag, where "changed" is
# any of:
#
#   1. a file under its directory changed;
#   2. its packaged manifest changed without one — a `[workspace.dependencies]`
#      entry it uses was bumped, its requirement on an internal crate moved, or
#      a `[workspace.package]` field it inherits changed. Compared as `cargo
#      metadata` sees the package at the tag and at HEAD, so that what counts
#      is what cargo would publish, not how the TOML is laid out;
#   3. an internal crate it depends on takes a breaking bump. The internal
#      requirements are carets on the compatible part of the version ("0.10"),
#      so a non-breaking bump of cctop-rmux-proto leaves a published
#      cctop-rmux-sdk@0.10.3 building beside it, and nothing else moves. A
#      breaking one (0.10.x -> 0.11.0) has to move the requirement, and a
#      moved requirement is rule 2;
#      this rule is the same thing said before the bump, so that `needs-bump`
#      can answer it.
#
# Whether a crate's public API broke is cargo-semver-checks' answer, comparing
# the crate at HEAD with the same crate at the tag. Only crates that changed
# under rules 1-2 are asked, and only on a release, because each one builds the
# crate's rustdoc twice. The version is pinned in rust-toolchain.toml, beside
# the toolchain whose rustdoc it reads. CCTOP_BREAKING, set (even empty), stands
# in for it: the space-separated crates whose API broke, for a human without
# the tool who knows the answer.
#
# Commands:
#
#   check        The guard CI runs. On a release commit (the release version
#                differs from the last tag's) it fails, one `::error::` line per
#                crate, when a changed crate kept its version, an unchanged one
#                was bumped, a crate whose API broke took less than a breaking
#                bump, or an internal requirement is not the caret on its
#                dependency's current version; and prints what the release
#                will publish. On any other commit it says so and passes: a
#                branch changes crates without bumping them, and that is fine.
#   needs-bump   The published crates rules 1-3 say must be bumped, as
#                "name<TAB>reason<TAB>patch|breaking", closing rule 3 over the
#                API breaks rather than over the versions, so it answers before
#                anything is bumped.
#   base         The tag the other commands compare against.
#   unpublished  The published crates whose current version is not on
#                crates.io yet, in the order they must be published. What
#                the release workflow publishes.
#   version      The release version, and so the tag without its prefix.
#
# It never runs `cargo publish` in any form. It needs git, cargo, jq and curl,
# a checkout with its tags and history (`fetch-depth: 0` in CI), and for
# `check` on a release and `needs-bump`, cargo-semver-checks or CCTOP_BREAKING.
#
# CCTOP_RELEASE_BASE overrides the tag to compare against.
